This project aims to develop a highly accurate AI model for lip-syncing, precisely aligning the lip movements of characters in a video with the corresponding audio. Utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the model will accommodate various languages, accents, and speech rates, with the goal of revolutionizing multimedia content creation for a seamless integration of audio and visual elements.

The input files used are:

    Video - https://openinapp.co/5cwva
    Audio - https://openinapp.co/o9vuj

Used Wav2Lip to lipsync using pretrained model downloaded using https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.
